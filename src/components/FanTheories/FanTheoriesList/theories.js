        title: "Bucky Barnes was brainwashed into killing Peter Parker's parents while he was the Winter Soldier",
        description: "In Captain America: Civil War, Bucky Barnes, as the Winter Soldier, is revealed to have been brainwashed by Zola to carry out numerous assassinations, including the murder of Tony Stark's parents. Fans speculate he may have also killed Peter Parker's parents. This theory is supported by the fact that homecoming is one of Bucky's mind control trigger words and the title of the first Spider-Man film with Tom Holland. Additionally, like Tony's parents, Peter's parents could have been involved with SHIELD, making them targets for HYDRA."

        description: "In Eternals, Sersi discovers that the Eternals, thought to be Earth's protectors, are partly responsible for its potential destruction. Phastos creates ring devices for the Eternals to channel their power to prevent this. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Wenwu gains powers and longevity from the rings he finds. A Reddit theory suggests these rings resulted from a failed Eternals rebellion against the Celestials millennia ago. Phastos made them for the Eternals, but their rebellion failed, leading to Earth's destruction and their memory wipe. The rings landed on Earth, where Wenwu found and used them to build his empire."

        title: "WandaVision and the Loki series are connected",
        description: "In 2021, WandaVision and Loki sparked numerous fan theories, with one intriguing theory connecting the two. The theory begins with the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which manages Nexus events to prevent the Sacred Timeline from branching, using technology invented by Kang (He Who Remains). In WandaVision, Wanda becomes Scarlet Witch, a Nexus being, creating a Nexus event. The TVA would need to reset the timeline and eliminate her, but she is too powerful. This is where He Who Remains comes in. The Reddit user suggests that Kang anticipated this and orchestrated events to unleash infinite variants of himself through Sylvie to ultimately defeat Scarlet Witch. This would allow Kang Prime to end the multiversal war and reestablish himself as He Who Remains. While some note that Loki is placed before WandaVision in the official timeline, the theory remains compelling."

        title: "For Avengers: Age Of Ultron, there was a cover-up of the Avengers' involvement in creating Ultron",
        description: "Reddit user u/eyejafjallajokull theorizes that the Avengers' role in creating Ultron was covered up, explaining that since Tony Stark faced no backlash for destroying a country, the government likely orchestrated a cover-up and found a scapegoat. Alternatively, they could have fabricated a story about Ultron's origins. The only person blamed for Ultron was Zemo, though not accurately. This theory suggests the possibility of a deliberate effort to shield the Avengers from accountability."

        description: "Reddit user u/CaptainFunktastic speculates on the future of the Guardians of the Galaxy, given Dave Bautista's departure and rumors of Rocket's death. In Phase Four's theme of new beginnings, if Drax survives, he and Mantis might retire together. Rocket is expected to die due to the High Evolutionary, and Groot might join Thor, potentially becoming Throot. Peter Quill would then say goodbye to an empty ship and vanish into the universe. This would necessitate finding replacements for the team, marking a significant shift for the Guardians."

        title: "HYDRA is the reason there's no X-Men in the Marvel movies and no Avengers in Fox movies",
        description: "A theory suggests HYDRA's rise explains the absence of X-Men in Avengers movies and vice versa. In the MCU, HYDRA's conquest of Germany prevented the Holocaust, so Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) was never imprisoned or experimented on, never discovered his powers, and never met Xavier, preventing the formation of the X-Men. Mutants exist but remain hidden. Conversely, in the Fox universe, HYDRA never rose to power, so the SSR (future SHIELD) was never created. Consequently, Captain America never got his powers, Howard Stark didn't develop the Arc Reactor, and Clint and Natasha never joined SHIELD, resulting in no Avengers."

        title: "At the end of Captain America: The First Avenger, SHIELD intentionally made the mistake of having dates that already passed",
        description: "A Redditor believes SHIELD intentionally played the wrong baseball game when Steve Rogers woke up after 70 years to test him. Steve was chosen for his intelligence, bravery, and cleverness, so if he didn't notice the incorrect dates, it would raise concerns about his suitability as the original super-soldier. This was likely the first of several subtle tests to ensure his mental and cognitive functions were intact after being frozen for so long."

        title: "Instead of the Mind Stone giving Pietro his powers, he actually got them from Wanda",
        description: "A theory suggests that Scarlet Witch may have unintentionally given Quicksilver his powers. WandaVision reveals that Wanda does not fully understand her powers, which include creating life and altering DNA. Agatha confirms Wanda's ability to do these things, suggesting she might have granted Pietro his abilities without realizing it. Additionally, Monica Rambeau gained superpowers after passing through Wanda's Hex barrier three times, demonstrating that Wanda's powers can affect others without her intent. This supports the idea that Wanda could have similarly empowered Pietro during their childhood, though more evidence exists to support this theory."

        description: "Reddit user u/the_war_won theorizes that the post-credits scene from Venom: Let There Be Carnage is misunderstood. Instead of wanting to kill Spider-Man, Venom aims to ally with Peter Parker. In the next movie, Venom will try to track down Peter in a new universe, leading Eddie to believe Venom is turning against him. Venom will eventually join Peter to help him defeat the Sinister Six, resulting in Peter wearing the iconic black suit with the white Spider-Man emblem. Eddie will then hate Peter, and when Venom reunites with Eddie, it will retain the Spider-Man emblem and web-slinging powers, aligning more closely with the comics."

        title: "Black Widow is actually alive and she just didn't return in Avengers: Endgame because she's waiting on Vormir",
        description: "A Redditor suggests a simpler explanation for Natasha Romanoff's potential return. They theorize that Captain America never returned the Soul Stone to its original timeline. Instead, Steve might have intervened on the planet, stopping Clint and Natasha when they arrived. He would have informed them that Natasha needed to stay behind to ensure the timeline's integrity and that her return was planned for after the final battle. This action would prevent timeline disruption, as removing an Infinity Stone creates a new branch, and returning it restores the timeline. Therefore, Hulk couldn't bring Natasha back because she is still alive in the original timeline, rather than being resurrected."

        description: "A theory suggests Iron Man might not be dead after all. Reddit user u/Carrot-Imaginary proposes that Tony Stark's consciousness became an AI after his death, similar to his fate in the comics. They point out that in Avengers: Endgame, Tony’s hologram accurately faces his daughter Morgan, suggesting a level of awareness. This implies his conscience might have been backed up into his Iron Man helmet, making him effectively alive as an AI."

        description: "Redditor u/Dreadful_menace theorizes that M'Baku might have become king of Wakanda in Black Panther due to his strength and capability. During the battle against Thanos's army, M'Baku matched the pace of Captain America, Thor, and Black Panther, demonstrating his power. With T'Challa and Shuri dusted in Avengers: Infinity War, M'Baku was likely the most capable candidate to lead Wakanda during those five years. His demonstrated strength and the broken royal line of succession suggest he could have assumed the throne out of necessity during Wakanda's darkest time."

        title: "Heimdall Was The Actual Guardian Of The Soul Stone",
        description: "Before Avengers: Infinity War, the Soul Stone’s location was unknown, but fans noticed a pattern where the locations of the other stones nearly spelled out Thanos, leaving only an H for the missing Soul Stone. This led to speculation that Heimdall, with his yellow eyes and magic, might have held the final stone. This theory suggested that Heimdall's role could have been more significant if the Soul Stone had been with him, adding weight to his death compared to its actual location on Vormir."

        title: "Thanos adopted Gamora specifically as a sacrifice for the Soul Stone, but when he grew too attached to her, he adopted Nebula to be sacrificed by Gamora instead",
        description: "The theory posits that Thanos, aware of the Soul Stone's sacrifice requirement, adopted Gamora, despite having no family, and grew to love her. To secure the Soul Stone, he planned for Gamora to sacrifice her sister Nebula. Thanos deliberately pitted them against each other, ensuring Gamora always won by making Nebula weaker with cybernetic replacements. This fostered deep resentment in Nebula, ensuring she would fight fiercely if needed. Nebula's knowledge of the Soul Stone's price and her reaction when Gamora was taken, as well as her warning to Clint and Natasha about Vormir, support this theory."

        title: "Bruce Banner's Super Soldier Serum wasn't the fail we think it was. He actually got it right",
        description: "In The Incredible Hulk, Bruce Banner's transformation into the Hulk results from an experiment to recreate the Super Soldier Serum. A Reddit user argues that it’s unlikely the serum was flawed, as it was developed decades after World War II. According to the theory, since the serum amplifies inherent traits, as seen with Red Skull's increased evilness, the serum given to Banner correctly enhanced his physical strength and amplified his pre-existing rage. Therefore, the Hulk embodies and magnifies Bruce’s rage, aligning with the serum's intended effects."

        title: "Thanos gives Loki the Mind Stone in Avengers, not to get the Space Stone, but to further corrupt Loki and destabilize Asgard so Thanos could eventually invade an unprotected Nidavellir and force Eitri into making the Infinity Gauntlet",
        description: "This theory suggests Thanos used Loki and the Mind Stone as a distraction to reach Nidavellir. According to the theory, Thanos orchestrated Loki’s corruption and the New York attack to destabilize the Asgardian royalty, making them vulnerable. This disruption allowed Thanos to target Nidavellir, the forge capable of creating the Infinity Gauntlet. While Loki was initially offered the Mind Stone to conquer Earth, Thanos’s real aim was to weaken Asgard’s defense of the forge. Thanos’s strategy involved creating conflict within the Asgardian family, ultimately forcing Eitri to forge the Gauntlet. Eitri's remark in Avengers: Infinity War about Asgard’s failure to protect Nidavellir supports this theory. The idea is that by provoking Loki to challenge Odin and disrupt the Asgardian defense, Thanos could exploit Nidavellir’s forge without facing its full defense. Rocket’s knowledge of Nidavellir suggests Thanos was aware of its significance. Thanos’s manipulation of Loki thus served to clear the path for acquiring the Gauntlet and fulfilling his grand plan."

        title: "Vision’s mention of the Ship of Theseus is not simply a nod to his character but to the MCU moving forward with variants, Skrulls, and multiversal versions of characters",
        description: "A Redditor theorizes that Phase Four of the MCU will focus on identity and how characters perceive themselves. This phase will explore how characters confront and redefine their identities, such as Jane Foster becoming Thor, Loki discovering he is a variant, and the Avengers replacing their original members. The theme of identity is reflected in WandaVision, where both Vision and Wanda grapple with their self-perceptions. The multiverse will further expand this theme, introducing different versions of characters from alternate universes, as seen in the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer. Additionally, the Avengers' lineup has changed significantly: Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and possibly Natasha Romanoff are gone, while characters like Thor are solo and Hulk has merged his identities. The team now includes new members, such as Sam Wilson as Captain America, highlighting the ongoing theme of identity and self-discovery in Phase Four."

        description: "A Redditor theorizes that Loki was more controlled by the Tesseract than he showed. The theory suggests that his glowing eyes and emotional reaction when Thor spoke to him indicate significant influence from the Tesseract, hinting that Loki's actions were heavily manipulated."
